## Getting Started

Deployed at [https://project-manager-d5b3-j6qe3knhi-lim1017.vercel.app/signin]

Built with NextJs 13, experimental App Router & Tailwind CSS

I Decided to build this simple CRUD app to work with some of the new features such as Server components, & async/await React components, middleware, new API & routing design.

BaseApp from Front-end masters course
